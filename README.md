# React Form with Tailwind, TypeScript, and useReducer

This repository contains a self-educational project exploring the implementation of a form in **React** using **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the `useReducer` hook for state management. The goal is to deepen understanding of state handling in React using `useReducer` as an alternative to `useState`, as well as to experiment with modern frontend development practices and styling using Tailwind CSS.

## üìö Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is educational. Specifically, it serves as a sandbox to:

- Learn and practice using the `useReducer` hook to manage form state in React.
- Integrate TypeScript for type safety and code clarity.
- Apply utility-first CSS design via Tailwind CSS.
- Understand the architecture and structure of scalable, typed React components.

This project is not intended for production use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (via Vite)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for fast development server and bundling)
